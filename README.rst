Operating System From Scratch
-----------------------------

Step 05: Kernel
```````````````

We will:

+ Learn how to mix asm and C, since we'll begin to program in C (see ``a/`` and ``b/``)
+ Load a simple kernel file into memory  (see ``c/``)
+ Enter protect mode (see ``d/``)
+ Parse the kernel file and place the contents in the right place in the memory (see ``e/``)
+ Begin to use C programming language to develop the kernel (see ``f/``)
+ Re-arrange our source files in a directory tree (see ``g/``)
+ Add interrupt handlers to kernel (see ``h/`` and ``i/``)

Now we have a running **Kernel**! Hurrah for the **Kernel**!
